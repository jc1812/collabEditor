# Collaborative Text Editor

This is a very simple implementation of a collaborative text editor that runs in the browser. It allows users to edit a document simultaneously and chat. It was built using [ace](https://ace.c9.io/) and [socket.io](https://socket.io/).

(Hint: open the example in multiple tabs to test the collab and chat features.)
